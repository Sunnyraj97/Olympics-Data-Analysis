## 🎯 Objective
This project analyzes 120 years of Olympic history to understand:
- **Who competes** (athlete participation)

- **Which sports dominate** (top medal-producing sports)

It enables analysts and federations to derive insights from global Olympic data and identify patterns across sports, geography, and gender.
